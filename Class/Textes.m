      op='When an .OP statement is included in an input file, the DC operating point of the\ncircuit is calculated. You can also use the .OP statement to produce an operating\npoint during a transient analysis. Only one .OP statement can appear in a StarHspice\nsimulation'
      sens='If a .SENS statement is included in the input file, Star-Hspice determines the DC small-signal sensitivities of each specified output variable relative to every circuit parameter. The sensitivity measurement is the partial derivative of each output variable with respect to the value of a given circuit element, taken at the operating point and normalized to the total change in output magnitude. Therefore, the sum of the sensitivities of all elements is 100%. Sensitivities are calculated for resistors, voltage sources, current sources, diodes, and BJTs. You can only perform one .SENS analysis per simulation. If more than one .SENS statement is present, only the last one is run.'

      pz='Star-Hspice uses the Muller method to calculate the roots of polynomials N(s) and D(s). This method approximates the polynomial with a quadratic equation that fits through three points in the vicinity of a root. Successive iterations toward a particular root are obtained by finding the nearer root of a quadratic whose curve passes through the last three points. Pole/zero analysis results are based on the circuit’s DC operating point, so the operating point solution must be accurate. Consequently, the .NODESET statement (not .IC) is recommended for initialization to avoid DC convergence problems'

Star-Hspice supports source value sweep, referring to the source name (SPICE style). However, if parameter sweep, a .DATA statement, and temperature sweep are selected, a parameter name must be chosen for the source value and subsequently referred to in the .DC statement. The parameter name can not start with V or I.'
      TEMP='The temperature of a circuit for a Star-Hspice run is specified with the .TEMP statement or with the TEMP parameter in the .DC, .AC, and .TRAN statements.

For example, if MEASDGT=5, numbers displayed by .MEASURE are displayed as: five decimal digits for numbers in scientific notation five digits to the right of the decimal for numbers between 0.1 and 999 INGOLD = 2 Exclusively exponential format (SPICE2G style). Exponential format generates constant number sizes  suitable for post-analysis tools. In the listing (.lis), file, all .MEASURE output values are in scientific notation, so .OPTIONS MEASDGT=5 results in five decimal digits. Use MEASDGT in conjunction with .OPTIONS INGOLD=x to control the output data format.'
      NODE='causes a node cross reference table to be printed. NODE is suppressed by BRIEF. The table lists each node and all the elements connected to it. The terminal of each element is indicated by a code, separated from the element name with a colon (:).
